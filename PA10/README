// -- ~ Assignment 10 Part I, Implement a Stack ~ -- //

A stack is just a linked-list; however, you only ever add and remove
elements to and from the head. It is as simple as that. 

You are already familiar with the "Call Stack", which shares an 
import property that the last function-frame added to the call-stack
is the first function-frame removed when the stack is shrunk. 
This property is called LIFO, or "Last-in-first-out".

When you add an element to a stack, that is called "pushing". When
you remove, that is called "popping". If you pushed (in order) the
number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then your stack would be the linked list:

    [5] -> [4] -> [3] -> [2] -> [1] -> (null)

Now if you popped an element, you would pop '5', and the stack would be:

    [4] -> [3] -> [2] -> [1] -> (null)

Simple.

You have to implement five functions for working with a stack:

Stack * Stack_create();
void Stack_destroy(Stack * stack);
int Stack_isEmpty(Stack * stack);
int Stack_popFront(Stack * stack);
void Stack_pushFront(Stack * stack, int value);

Further instructions are in the file "answer10.c"

You will have to test these functions yourself. They are required
for Part II, but will not be graded.




// -- ~ Assignment 10 Part II, Stack Sort ~ -- //

In the this part of the assignment, you are required to implement
Donald Knuth's "Stack Sort" algorithm. This is an extremely fast
sorting algorithm (must faster than quick-sort for large inputs);
however, it has a flaw; Stack Sort only works for certain inputs.
These inputs are called "stack sortable", and what that looks like,
and why it is important, will become apparent in the second part of
the assignment.

Stack Sort works as follows:

Initialize an empty stack
For each input value x:
      While the stack is nonempty and x is 
      larger than the top item on the stack:
             pop the stack to the output
      Push x onto the stack
While the stack is nonempty, pop it to the output

You are required to implement the function:

void stackSort(int * array, int len);

Further instructions are in the file "answer10.c"




// -- ~ Assignment 10 Part III, All Possible Binary Tree Shapes ~ -- //

In this part of the assignment, we'll generate all possible shapes
for a binary tree.
 
If a binary tree has only one node, there is one and only one shape.

If a binary tree has two nodes, there are two shapes.

         N                  N
        /         or         \
       N                      N

Here, N is one node.

If a binary tree has three nodes, there are five shapes.

         N           N
        /           /      
       N            N       
      /             \
     N               N

           N
          / \
         N   N

        N            N
         \            \
          N            N
         /              \
        N                N

The number of shapes for k nodes can be expresses as the Catalan
series.

// -- Stack Sort and Binary Trees -- //

Please implement stackSort(...) before reading this section.

Generating all the possible shapes with k nodes is surprisingly 
subtle; however, it can be done if we understand how and why 
"Stack Sort" can fail. Really! 

Stack Sort only works on lists of numbers that are "stack-sortable".
This works as follows:

Consider two lists: 'u' = { 1, 2, 4, 3 } and 'v' = { 3, 1, 4, 2 }.
The 'u' is stack-sortable, but 'v' is not. To understand why, 
consider what happens when we divide the lists around their largest
element:

 'u' = { 1, 2, 4, 3 } ==> { 1, 2 } 4 { 3 }
 'v' = { 3, 1, 4, 2 } ==> { 3, 1 } 4 { 2 }

Note that if we do this recursively, we're making binary trees!

Okay, so when we run the "Stack Sort" algorithm, when we reach '4', we
must output all of the left-children. { 1, 2 } in the first example, 
and { 3, 1 } in the second example. This is all well and good, but
in the second example we have to output '3' before we output '2', and
so the sort fails.

List 'v' violates the so-called "231" sequence rule. That means that,
reading left-to-right, once you go larger than a number (3 is	
larger than 2), you can never go smaller again (1 is smaller than 2).

It so happens that if a sequence is of numbers is not stack-sortable,
and you produced a binary tree from this sequence, then there is
precisely one stack-sortable sequence (of the same length) that would
produce the same shaped binary tree. Furthermore, all stack-sortable
sequences produce uniquely shaped binary trees! This means that you
can get the unique binary trees with 'k' nodes by building trees from
all of the stack-sortable sequences of 'k' length.

// -- All the Unique Shapes of a Binary Tree of size 'k' -- //

To generate all the unique shapes of a binary tree with 'k' nodes,
you simply generate all the permutations of an array of unique
numbers of length 'k', and if the permutation is "stack-sortable", then
simply insert the permutation into a binary tree and print it.

That's it!

You must implement the function:

int isStackSortable(int * array, int len);
void genShapes(int n);

For your convenience, you have been supplied with an implementation
of a binary tree, in the files tree.c and tree.h.

Further instructions are in the file "answer10.c"

// -- ~ Making Sure Your Answer is Correct. ~ -- //

You must run valgrind yourself, and check the output for
memory errors. Please consult the TAs if you are unsure how to validate
your program for memory errors.

To help you verify the correctness of your solution, we have provided
and 'expected' directory that contains 27 files: 9 'shapes' files,
9 'stack-sortable' files, and 9 'stack-unsortable' files.

The shapes-K files contain all the unique binary tree shapes for
binary trees of K nodes. You must be able to generate all of these
shapes without duplicates. You can use sort and diff to check that
you have generated all of them correctly.

The 'stack-sortable' and 'stack-unsortable' files contain lists of
permutations that are either stack-sortable or stack-unsortable.
Your isStackSortable(...) function must correctly identify all
permutations in the 'stack-sortable' files as sortable, and all 
permutations in the 'stack-unsortable' files as unsortable.

It may be helpful to read these files into your own main(...) 
function, and iterate over each line (remember earlier assignments!)
and check the behaviour if isStackSortable(...) and stackSort(...).

Remember that stackSort must fail to produce a sorted list if the
input is not stack-sortable.
