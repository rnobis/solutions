Welcome to the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue
 University! I hope that the information in our web-pages will convey
 to you the dynamic quality of the programs available at Purdue
 ECE. Our programs are consistently ranked among the best in the
 country, and we are justifiably proud of our faculty, students and
 facilities.

Our computing and laboratory facilities are outstanding. The
Engineering Computer Network (ECN) provides students access to a
variety of machines, from PCs to supercomputers. The laboratory
facilities, most of which are housed in the Electrical Engineering
Building and the Materials and Electrical Engineering Building, are
state of the art.

Over 80 faculty members serve on our faculty, and about 900
undergraduates (sophomores through seniors) and over 650 graduate
students are enrolled as full-time students, making Purdue ECE among
the largest ECE departments in the nation. If you are interested in
information on our academic programs beyond what is readily available
on our web-pages, please contact the Graduate or Undergraduate Offices
(ecegrad@ecn.purdue.edu and eceugo@ecn.purdue.edu).
