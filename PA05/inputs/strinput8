Across the world, we need new energy sources, healthcare solutions,
environmentally friendly technologies, and an end to terrorism. At
Purdue these are a few of the issues we face every day. Our
engineering faculty, researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate
students are making hydrogen fuel cells more efficient, helping fight
AIDS in Africa, developing working evacuation-systems for natural
disasters, and creating technologies to prevent and deal with possible
terrorist attacks. Purdue engineers are working in virtually any area
in which their expertise can benefit humanity. In the College of
Engineering, we do everything we can to encourage and support our
people. They are engineering the solutions to the grand challenges of
the 21st century.
