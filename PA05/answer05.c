/*
 * Read a file of integers.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *
 * filename: the name of a file that contains a list of integers (one
 * per line)
 * 
 * numInteger: pointer to store the number of integers in the
 * file. You need to update the value stored at the address which is
 * the pointer's value.  If the function fails to update the value, it
 * is considered reading the file has failed.
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 * a array of integers from the file, or NULL if *any* error is
 * encountered.
 *
 * Hint: use fscanf
 *
 * You do NOT know how many integers are in the file until you have
 * read it. Once you know how many integers there are, you can modify
 * the "numberOfIntegers" variable. (Note that this is a pointer, not
 * an integer) You must allocate memory to store the integers.
 * 
 * Once memory is allocated to store the integers, you will need to
 * re-read the values from the file. To do this, you must reset the
 * file pointer to the beginning of the file using the function
 * "fseek". 
 *
 * You should not use rewind (if you have learned it somewhere).  The
 * difference of rewind and fseek is that rewind does not tell you
 * whether it fails.  
 *
 * One way to read integeres is to use the "fscanf" function.  It is
 * easier than reading one character at a time by using fgetc.
 *
 * You must use malloc in this function.
 * 
 * Some old books encourage readers to type cast in front of malloc,
 * something like
 *
 * int * ptr = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * size);
 *
 * Type cast is no longer needed and in fact is discouraged now.  You
 * should *NOT* type cast malloc.  It is discouraged even though it is
 * not wrong.
 *
 * You will receive zero if you allocate a large array whose size is
 * independent of the number of integers in the file.  For example, if
 * you write this
 *
 * int array[10000];
 *

/*
 * Read a file of strings. This is similar to readInteger. However,
 * each string is an array of characters. The function needs to
 * allocate memory for an array of strings, i.e., array of arrays of
 * characters. In other words, this is a two-dimensional array (thus,
 * char **).
 *
 * Arguments:
 *
 * filename: the name of a file that contains a list of strings (one
 * per line)
 * 
 * numString: pointer to store the number of strings in the
 * file. You need to update the value stored at the address which is
 * the pointer's value.  If the function fails to update the value, it
 * is considered reading the file has failed.
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 * a array of strings from the file, or NULL if *any* error is
 * encountered.
