[o from there is a choice I leave to you.
thout rules and controls, without borders or boundaries; a world where anything is possible.
to show them a world... without you.
to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.
e to tell you how it's going to begin.
ome here to tell you how this is going to end.
ow the future.
aid of change.
aid of us.
t you're afraid.
 you now.
're out there.
