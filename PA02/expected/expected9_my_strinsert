[Noble six hundred.
Honor the Light Brigade,
Honor the charge they made,
All the world wondered.
O the wild charge they made!
When can their glory fade?
6.
Left of six hundred.
All that was left of them,
Back from the mouth of Hell,
Came thro' the jaws of Death
They that had fought so well
While horse and hero fell,
Storm'd at with shot and shell,
Volley'd and thunder'd;
Cannon behind them
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon to right of them,
5.
Not the six hundred.
Then they rode back, but not
Shatter'd and sunder'd.
Reel'd from the sabre stroke
Cossack and Russian
Right thro' the line they broke;
Plunged in the battery-smoke
All the world wonder'd:
Charging an army, while
Sabring the gunners there,
Flash'd as they turn'd in air,
Flash'd all their sabres bare,
4.
Rode the six hundred.
Into the mouth of Hell
Into the jaws of Death,
Boldly they rode and well,
Storm'd at with shot and shell,
Volley'd and thunder'd;
Cannon in front of them
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon to right of them,
3.
Rode the six hundred.
Into the valley of Death
Theirs but to do and die:
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs not to make reply,
Someone had blunder'd:
Not tho' the soldier knew
Was there a man dismay'd?
"Forward, the Light Brigade!"
Rode the six hundred.
Into the valley of Death
"Charge for the guns!" he said:
"Forward, the Light Brigade!
2.
Rode the six hundred.
All in the valley of Death
Half a league onward,
Half a league, half a league,
1.
