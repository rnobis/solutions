[Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.
A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries; a world where anything is possible.
I'm going to show them a world... without you.
I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.
I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.
I don't know the future.
You're afraid of change.
You're afraid of us.
I know that you're afraid.
I can feel you now.
I know you're out there.
