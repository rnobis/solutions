[In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
