This assignment will have you work with strings and pointers.  We ask
you to implement a number of string manipulation functions.  Many of
these functions are already available in the C standard library
(string.h); here we will create our own versions of these functions.
You are obviously NOT allowed to use the existing versions in your
implementing.  Instead, you must implement all the code yourself.

C uses an array of characters for storing a string.  This array must
have an element that stores the special character '\0' as the end of
the string.  The '\0' character *terminates* the string.

Please see the files pa02.h and answer02.c for the function prototypes
you will be asked to write.  Fill in answer02.c with your code and
submit only answer02.c through Blackboard.

While string management often requires you to manage memory as well,
this is not necessary for the functions we ask you write here.  You
should not be required to allocate memory, not even for temporary
storage.  If you find yourself using malloc(), strdup(), and/or
free(), you are not solving this problem in the correct way.  You will
lose points if you allocate or release memory.

NOTE:
The Makefile is set up test help you compile and test your code. 
Type "make help" for a list of options.
